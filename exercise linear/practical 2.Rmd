## Linear Modelling Exercises

1. Import the penguin data from the `palmerpenguin` package
2. Do big birds have big beaks? Fit a linear model between bill length and body mass, and interpret the coefficients.
3. Examine the diagnostics plots. Is everything OK?
3. Calculate the residual sum of squares (find sum the squared difference between the estimates calculated from the coefficients and the observed values).
4. Recalculate the Residual sum of squares using different values for the coefficients (in the formula yi = Beta + Beta xi + Îµi).
5. Is the new RSS larger or smaller?
6. Estimate the slope using covariance and variance.
7. Do you get the same result?
8. Add species to the model as a predictor.
9. Does species improve the model?
10. How should the coefficients be interpreted?
